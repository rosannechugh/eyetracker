#Basic Real-Time Eye Tracker using Python and OpenCV

This is a simple eye-tracking project built using Python and OpenCV. The application detects eyes in a webcam feed and tracks their movement in real-time.

##Features:
- Detects face and eyes using Haar Cascades
- Tracks basic eye movement live using webcam
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly
- Real-time performance

##Tech Stack:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifiers

##Installation:
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone
https://github.com/rosannechugh/eye-tracking.git
cd eye-tracking

2. Install dependencies (preferably in a virtual environment):
pip install opencv-python

3. Run the script:
python "eye tracking.py"

Make sure your webcam is connected and working.

**How It Works**:
1.OpenCV accesses the webcam feed.
2.Haar Cascade classifiers detect the face and eye regions.
3.Basic bounding boxes are drawn to show real-time tracking.

**Future Improvements**:
-Better eye detection using Dlib or Mediapipe
-Pupil center tracking and gaze direction
-Blink detection
-GUI integration
